# ConsoleLibrary
Library implementation with CRUD operations in your shell. Use `help` to get information about available commands or 
`help <command>` to get detailed information about particular command. There are some different bugs in IDE console
(doesn't work autocompletion and history) and in Linux terminal (problems with input). Since these bugs cant be resolved easily,
I will deal with it later (when get in-depth understanding of low-level work with the console).
